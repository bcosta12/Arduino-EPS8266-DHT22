# Arduino EPS8266 DHT22 MQ6

<<<<<<< HEAD
This Project connects an Arduino Uno who collects temperature, humidity, and LPG Gás (cooking Gás). I send the data in a UDP connection, that I programmed in Python language in the Server side and in C/C++ language in the Client (Arduino) side. 

The main idea of this project is:
1 - Collect temperature and humidity from the DHT22 sensor and send this data via the UDP connection;
2 - Collect LPG Gás from MQ6 sensor and light up a LED and ring an alarm (BUZZER) to alert the danger of explosion.

*Feel free to fork, comment, ask, criticism or suggest something to improve this project.

Acknolagenmet to Professor Diego Haddad from CEFET/RJ to make this project possible and the followings websites that I learn how to do this project.
