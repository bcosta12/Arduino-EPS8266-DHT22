# Arduino EPS8266 DHT22

    This Project connects an Arduino Uno who collects temperature, humidity.
I send the data in a UDP connection, that I programmed in Python language in the Server side and in C/C++ language in the Client (Arduino) side. 

# The main idea of this project is:

1 - Collect temperature and humidity from the DHT22 sensor;

2 - Send this data via the UDP connection.
